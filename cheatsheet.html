INTRODUCTION TO THE DOM (THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
- It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate the content of a web page using JavaScript.
- The DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded, and it consists of a hierarchy of nodes that represent elements, attributes, and text content.
- Each html element within the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons, is represented as a node in the DOM tree structure. 

HTML EVENTS
- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system or in the document, such as when a user clicks a button, hovers over an element, submits a form, or types in an input field.
- In web development, events are used to trigger JavaScript functions or scripts in response to user interactions with the web page.

- The most common HTML events are:
  - onclick: when an element is clicked.
  - onmouseover: when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.
  - onmouseout: when the mouse pointer is moved out of an element.
  - onkeydown: when a key is pressed down.
  - onsubmit: when a form is submitted.
  - onchange: when the value of an input element changes.
  - onfocus: when an element receives focus.

- Javascript events we can play with: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp#:~:text=An%20HTML%20event%20can%20be,HTML%20input%20field%20was%20changed
- A more comprehensive list of events can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events

Event handler versus event listener 
Event listener: Listens for an event to happen.
Event handler: The code that runs in response to the event happening.

// onclick is the event listener, myFunction is the event handler 
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

// "click" , myFunction is the event handler 
button.addEventListener("click", myFunction);


DOM MANIPULATION
Javascript can be used to manipulate the content of a web page by accessing and modifying the Document Object Model (DOM).

Common methods for DOM manipulation include:
1. getElementById(): Retrieves an element by its ID attribute.
  a. const variable = document.getElementById("id")
2. getElementsByClassName(): Retrieves elements by their class name.
  a. const variable = document.getElementsByClassName("classname")
3. getElementsByTagName(): Retrieves elements by their tag name.
  a. const variable = document.getElementsByTagName("tagname")
4. createElement(): Creates a new element node.
  a. const variable = document.createElement("a")
  b. a.innerHTML = "string"
5. appendChild(): Appends a child node to an element.
  a. document.getElementById("container").appendChild(a)

HTML ELEMENT MANIPULATION 
  Javascript enables us to interact with individual HTML elements and modify their properties or attributes.
  
  Common methods for element manipulation include:
  1. setAttribute(): Sets the value of an attribute on the specified element.
  2. getInnerHTML(): Retrieves the HTML content of an element.

FORM MANIPULATION
  Javascript methods allow us to manipulate form elements, retrieve user input, and perform form validation. 
  
  Common methods for form manipulation include:
  1. submit(): Submits the form data to the server.
  2. reset(): Resets the form fields to their initial values.
  a. document.getElementById().reset(); 
  3. elements[]: Accesses form elements by their index or name attribute.



Grabbing the value for username 

const username = event.target.elements.username.value; 

The event object represents an event that has occurred in the browser, such as a button click or a form submission. 
- The target property of the event object refers to the element on which the event occurred. 
  In this case, it seems that the event is related to a form submission, and the target property is likely referring to the form element.
- The elements property of the form element provides access to all the form controls within that form. 
  In this case, it is accessing the form control with the name attribute set to "username".
- The value property is used to retrieve the value entered by the user in the form control. 
  This value is then assigned to the username variable.
