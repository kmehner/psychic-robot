<!-- 
  INTRODUCTION TO THE DOM (THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
  - It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate the content of a web page using JavaScript.
  - The DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded, and it consists of a hierarchy of nodes that represent elements, attributes, and text content.
  - Each html element within the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons, is represented as a node in the DOM tree structure. 
  
  HTML EVENTS
  - Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system or in the document, such as when a user clicks a button, hovers over an element, submits a form, or types in an input field.
  - In web development, events are used to trigger JavaScript functions or scripts in response to user interactions with the web page.

  - The most common HTML events are:
    - onclick: when an element is clicked.
    - onmouseover: when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.
    - onmouseout: when the mouse pointer is moved out of an element.
    - onkeydown: when a key is pressed down.
    - onsubmit: when a form is submitted.
    - onchange: when the value of an input element changes.
    - onfocus: when an element receives focus.

  - Javascript events we can play with: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp#:~:text=An%20HTML%20event%20can%20be,HTML%20input%20field%20was%20changed

  Event handler versus event listener 
  Event listener: Listens for an event to happen.
  Event handler: The code that runs in response to the event happening.

  // onclick is the event listener, myFunction is the event handler 
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

  // "click" , myFunction is the event handler 
  button.addEventListener("click", myFunction);
  -->
<body>

  <!-- onclick event -->
  <button onclick="handleButtonClick()">Click Me</button>

  <br>

  <!-- onmouseover(handleMouseOver()) and onmouseout(handleMouseOut()) -->
  <div onmouseover="handleMouseOver()" onmouseout="handleMouseOut()">
    Hover over me
  </div>
   
   <br>

  <!-- onkeydown event -->
  <input type="text" onkeydown="handleKeyDown(event)">

  <br>

  <!-- Form: onSubmitEvent -->
  <form onsubmit="handleSubmit(event)">
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter Username">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>

  <!-- onchange event -->
  <input type="text" onchange="handleChange(event)" placeholder="Type here">

  <br>

  <!-- onfocus event -->
  <input type="text" onfocus="handleFocus()" placeholder="Click to focus">


   <!-- Script to define our functions -->
  <script>

    // Function for onclick event
    function handleButtonClick(){
      alert("Button clicked!");
    }

    // handleMouseOver
    function handleMouseOver(){
      console.log("Mouse over element"); 
    }

    // handleMouseOut
    function handleMouseOut(){
      console.log("Mouse out of element"); 
    }

    // handleKeyDown
    function handleKeyDown(event){
      console.log("Key pressed:", event.key); 
    }

    // handleSubmit
    function handleSubmit(event){
      // Prevents default browser behavior - refreshing a ton 
      event.preventDefault(); 

      /* Grabbing the value for username 
      The event object represents an event that has occurred in the browser, such as a button click or a form submission. 
      - The target property of the event object refers to the element on which the event occurred. 
        In this case, it seems that the event is related to a form submission, and the target property is likely referring to the form element.
      - The elements property of the form element provides access to all the form controls within that form. 
        In this case, it is accessing the form control with the name attribute set to "username".
      - The value property is used to retrieve the value entered by the user in the form control. 
        This value is then assigned to the username variable. */
      const username = event.target.elements.username.value; 

      console.log("Form submitted with username:", username)
    }

    // handleChange 
    function handleChange(event){
      console.log("Input value changed to:", event.target.value); 
    }

    // handleFocus
    function handleFocus(){
      console.log("Input element focused"); 
    }
